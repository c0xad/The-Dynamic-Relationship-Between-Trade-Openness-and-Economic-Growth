# Methodology: Trade Openness and Economic Growth in Turkey

## Data Collection and Preparation

### Data Sources
- World Development Indicators (World Bank)
- Penn World Tables
- IMF International Financial Statistics

### Time Period
1960-2022 (or latest available data)

### Key Variables
1. **Dependent Variable**:
   - GDP growth rate (annual %)

2. **Main Independent Variables**:
   - Trade Openness ((Exports + Imports)/GDP)
   - Exports (% of GDP)
   - Imports (% of GDP)

3. **Control Variables**:
   - Investment (proxied by Industry Value Added, % of GDP)
   - Human Capital (proxied by tertiary education enrollment)
   - Inflation Rate (annual %)
   - Government Expenditure (% of GDP)
   - High-tech Exports (% of manufactured exports)

### Data Transformations
1. Standardization of education variables
2. Generation of interaction terms
3. Calculation of 5-year moving averages
4. Creation of period dummies for structural breaks

## Analytical Framework

### 1. Descriptive Analysis
- Time series plots of key variables
- Summary statistics by 5-year periods
- Correlation analysis

### 2. Basic Panel Analysis
- OLS with period controls
- Fixed Effects estimation
- Random Effects estimation

### 3. Dynamic Panel Analysis
#### Base Model:
```
gdp_growth(t) = β₀ + β₁gdp_growth(t-1) + β₂trade_openness(t) + β₃X(t) + ε(t)
```
where X(t) represents control variables

#### Extended Model with Interactions:
```
gdp_growth(t) = β₀ + β₁gdp_growth(t-1) + β₂trade_openness(t) + 
                β₃X(t) + β₄(trade_openness × investment) +
                β₅(trade_openness × human_capital) + ε(t)
```

### 4. Non-linear Effects Analysis
Testing for threshold effects in trade openness:
```
gdp_growth(t) = β₀ + β₁trade_openness(t) + β₂trade_openness²(t) + β₃X(t) + ε(t)
```

### 5. Robustness Checks
1. Using 5-year averages to control for business cycles
2. Subsample analysis for different periods:
   - Pre-liberalization (before 1980)
   - Post-liberalization (1980-2001)
   - Post-2001 crisis (2001-present)

### 6. Causality Analysis
- Granger causality tests using VAR framework
- Analysis of lead-lag relationships

## Structural Break Periods

1. **Pre-1980**: Import substitution period
   - Characterized by protectionist policies
   - State-led industrialization

2. **1980-2001**: Post-liberalization period
   - Trade liberalization
   - Export-oriented growth strategy
   - Capital account liberalization

3. **Post-2001**: Modern period
   - Aftermath of 2001 financial crisis
   - Institutional reforms
   - Enhanced integration with global markets

## Output and Interpretation

### Key Outputs
1. Regression tables with various specifications
2. Time series plots of key variables
3. Period-specific summary statistics
4. Granger causality test results

### Interpretation Focus
1. Direction and magnitude of trade openness effects
2. Significance of interaction terms
3. Evidence of non-linear relationships
4. Period-specific variations in the trade-growth relationship
5. Causality direction between trade and growth
