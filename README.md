# The Dynamic Relationship Between Trade Openness and Economic Growth

This repository contains advanced research analyzing the dynamic relationship between trade openness and economic growth, with a particular focus on Turkey's experience from 1960 to 2022, employing sophisticated econometric techniques and theoretical frameworks.

## Project Overview

This research project investigates how trade openness affects economic growth through multiple channels, using advanced econometric techniques including dynamic panel analysis, threshold regression models, and stochastic differential equations. The study examines direct effects, non-linear relationships, institutional complementarities, and dynamic adjustment processes.
